# 📱 Deconstruct (Previously SyntaxFound)

**Deconstruct** is an iOS app that helps aspiring developers build real coding fluency by mastering syntax — one line at a time.

Instead of just solving problems, users rebuild them from the ground up through interactive prompts. From identifying syntax errors to writing solutions line-by-line, Deconstruct transforms technical interview prep into an active, thoughtful learning experience.

- AI-generated challenges
Each exercise is dynamically created using OpenAI to reflect real-world patterns and mistakes.
- Multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, and code writing
Mix and match formats to keep practice engaging and memorable.
