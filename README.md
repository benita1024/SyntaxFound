# 📱 SyntaxFound

**SyntaxFound** is an iOS app that turns coding practice into an interactive, game-like experience.

Users can filter LeetCode-style questions by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard), explore problems by pattern (e.g., Two Sum, Sliding Window), and solve a mix of:
- ✅ Multiple-choice questions
- ✏️ Fill-in-the-blank challenges
- 💬 Short-answer prompts generated using OpenAI

Progress is tracked with XP, daily streaks, and completed problems, making technical interview prep more engaging and game-like.
